          <h1>Hi, My name is Manuel Reyes.</h1>
          <p>With over than 8 years as QA Engineer, I have Implemented manual and automatic tests, development of test scripts with Java, JavaScript, Json and Node Js. 
            Implementation of projects with frameworks such as WebdriverIO, Seleniums Java (POM) and API Testing Automation (Postman). 
            Execution of manual and automatic test scripts with Jenkins (master/slave) nodes, Maven, Freestyle, Pipelines 
            (scripts/jenkinsfile) Jobs with (bat, ssh), etc, Docker (images/containers), Git repositories and AWS 
            (instances/clusters/repositories) with CI/CD complete pipeline configuration. Implementation of Functional Tests, 
            Integration Tests, Regression Tests, Performance Tests and Acceptance Tests.
          </p>

          <p>I have decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
